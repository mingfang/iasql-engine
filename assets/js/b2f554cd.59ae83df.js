It comes with modern tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters & offer paid\\nsubscriptions to members.\\n\\nGhost is a software as a service product, but it is built totally on open source and offers a self-hosted, self-serve version. This version can be hosted on AWS using several approaches, and one of them.\\n\\nStarting an EC2 instance and manually triggering the installation commands is a procedure that can be done manually, but there are also another dependencies involved, such as the creation of proper security groups.\\nIt is time-consuming task, specially if you need to install several instances. This article will offer a way to install Ghost with one-click on IaSQL using an EC2 instance on Ubuntu as highlighted <a href=\\"https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/\\">here</a>.\\n\\n_This approach uses <a href=\\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html\\">EC2 user data</a> functionality - to run an startup script that will configure Ghost\\nas soon as the instance is started - and <a href=\\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html\\">EC2 instance metadata</a> - to retrieve\\nthe public IP of the instance, and assign it dynamically to Ghost installation script.\\n\\n## Pre-requisites\\n\\nThis post is going to rely on EC2 to install the Ghost content. In order to access to the instance, it is recommended to setup an SSH key, to be able to access it later for modifications and maintenance. So we will be generating some keys\\nand importing them to later associate with the EC2 instance. If you do not have an existing key, please generate one. The output of the public key will be the one imported into the system:\\n\\n```bash\\nssh-keygen -t rsa -f /tmp/key\\nPUBKEY=$(cat /tmp/key.pub)\\n```\\n\\nThe public key will be then imported into the system:\\n\\n```sql TheButton[Generate keypair]=\\"Import keypair\\"\\n -- Install modules\\nSELECT\\n  *\\nFROM\\n  iasql_install (\'aws_ec2\', \'aws_ec2_metadata\');\\n\\n-- Request a keypair\\nSELECT * FROM key_pair_import (\'ghost\', \'<your_pubkey_content>\', \'us-east-2\');\\n```\\n\\n## Ghost installation\\n\\nAfter the keypair has been imported, we can proceed with the installation of the instance itself, associating the created key to allow SSH access after it is created.\\n\\n\\n```sql TheButton[Install Ghost]=\\"Install Ghost\\"\\n-- start transaction\\nSELECT * FROM iasql_begin();\\n\\n-- insert security groups\\nINSERT INTO\\n  security_group (description, group_name)\\nVALUES\\n  (\'Ghost security group\', \'ghost_sg\');\\n\\nINSERT INTO\\n  security_group_rule (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description, security_group_id)\\nSELECT\\n  t.is_egress,\\n  t.ip_protocol,\\n  t.from_port,\\n  t.to_port,\\n  t.cidr_ipv4::cidr,\\n  t.description,\\n  security_group.id\\nFROM\\n  security_group,\\n  (\\n    VALUES\\n      (FALSE, \'tcp\', 22, 22, \'0.0.0.0/0\', \'ghost_sg_rule_ssh\'),\\n      (FALSE, \'tcp\', 80, 80, \'0.0.0.0/0\', \'ghost_sg_rule_http\'),\\n      (FALSE, \'tcp\', 443, 443, \'0.0.0.0/0\', \'ghost_sg_rule_https\'),\\n      (TRUE, \'tcp\', 1, 65535, \'0.0.0.0/0\', \'ghost_sg_rule_egress\')\\n  ) AS t (is_egress, ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ipv4, description)\\nWHERE\\n  security_group.group_name = \'ghost_sg\';\\n\\n-- insert instance with the right userdata\\nINSERT INTO\\n  instance (ami, instance_type, subnet_id, tags, user_data, key_pair_name, region)\\nSELECT\\n  \'resolve:ssm:/aws/service/canonical/ubuntu/server/22.04/stable/current/amd64/hvm/ebs-gp2/ami-id\',\\n  \'t2.small\',\\n  subnet.id,\\n  \'{\\"name\\":\\"ghost-blog\\"}\',\\n  \'#!/bin/bash\\nuseradd -m ghostuser\\nusermod -a -G sudo ghostuser\\necho \\"ghostuser ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\\" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ghostuser\\nsudo -E apt-get update -y\\nsudo -E apt-get upgrade -y\\nsudo -E apt-get -y install nginx\\nsudo -E ufw allow \\"Nginx Full\\"\\nsudo -E apt-get -y install mysql-server\\nsudo -E mysql -u root -e \\"ALTER USER \\"root\\"@\\"localhost\\" IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY \\\\\\"ghost\\\\\\";\\"\\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash\\nsudo -E apt-get -y install nodejs\\nsudo npm install ghost-cli@latest -g\\nsudo -E mkdir -p /var/www/ghost\\nsudo -E chown ghostuser /var/www/ghost\\nsudo chmod 775 /var/www/ghost\\ncd /var/www/ghost/\\nsudo -u ghostuser ghost install --url http://$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) --db mysql --dbpass ghost --no-prompt --start --enable\\n\', \'ghost\',\\n  \'us-east-2\'\\nFROM\\n  subnet\\n  INNER JOIN vpc ON vpc.id = subnet.vpc_id\\n  AND vpc.is_default = \'Y\'\\nWHERE\\n  vpc.region = \'us-east-2\'\\n  AND subnet.availability_zone = \'us-east-2a\'\\nLIMIT\\n  1;\\n\\n-- insert instance security groups\\nINSERT INTO\\n  instance_security_groups (instance_id, security_group_id)\\nSELECT\\n  (\\n    SELECT\\n      id\\n    FROM\\n      instance\\n    WHERE\\n      tags ->> \'name\' = \'ghost-blog\'\\n    LIMIT\\n      1\\n  ),\\n  (\\n    SELECT\\n      id\\n    FROM\\n      security_group\\n    WHERE\\n      group_name = \'ghost_sg\'\\n      AND region = \'us-east-2\'\\n    LIMIT\\n      1\\n  );\\n\\nSELECT\\n  *\\nFROM\\n  iasql_commit();\\n```\\n\\n## Accessing Ghost\\n\\nAfter the process finishes (it will take over 10-15 minutes), you will have your Ghost instance installed, publicly accessible through the public IP of the spinned instance.\\nYou can get the details of the public IP of your instance querying for the metadata:\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT\\n  public_ip_address\\nFROM\\n  instance_metadata\\nWHERE\\n  id = (\\n    SELECT\\n      id\\n    FROM\\n      instance\\n    WHERE\\n      tags ->> \'name\' = \'ghost-blog\'\\n    LIMIT\\n      1\\n  );\\n```\\n\\nThe initial Ghost installation will be available on the browser just query by `http://<public_ip_address>/ghost`:\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/configure_ghost.png\\" style={{ maxWidth: 600 }} />\\n\\nThis is the basic installation of Ghost, but it is just meant for development and testing purposes.

In order to get your application up and running on ECS, you have to go through a bunch of resource creation.

Doing those steps manually is going to give you a headache as well, so why bother doing all those steps yourself and risking different errors you might face when deploying your containerized app? You don\'t really have the time for the random IAM-related errors AWS is demanding you to resolve. Besides, you already have your codebase ready and the `Dockerfile` is there, so why not just run a simple command doing something that should be simply done?\\n\\nIn this post, we\'re going to discover an IaSQL module that\'s built to make deploying to ECS, simplified. Most of the details for deploying a container to ECS are the same (load balancers, security groups, IAM roles, etc), and we have created the `aws_ecs_simplified` module for you so that you can give it any Github repo with a `Dockerfile` and get your app deployed to ECS in the fastest time possible, with scalability available! All the needed resources are going to be created automatically in your AWS account, and you\'ll have the full access to the details while you\'re gaining the benefit of a higher-level simple deployment.\\n\\n## ** An Example Usage of the `aws_ecs_simplified` Module **\\n\\nLet\'s say we are going to deploy [this simple Express.js app](https://github.com/iasql/iasql-engine/tree/main/examples/ecs-fargate/prisma/app) to the ECS. It has a `Dockerfile` and `package.json` that installs `express` on `npm install`. `npm start` then starts the Express server which listens on port `8088`.\\n\\n:::note\\n`aws_ecs_simplified` is a high-level module we have created to make scalable ECS deployments easier. For more info on high-level vs low-level modules, you can check [this guide](https://iasql.com/docs/low-level-vs-high-level/).\\n:::\\n\\nLet\'s go and deploy the above app to your AWS account. Don\'t worry if you don\'t have an IaSQL database already, you can create one for free when you click the \\"Deploy Now\\" button.\\n```sql title=\\"Deploy a simple Express.js app from a Github repository to ECS\\" showLineNumbers TheButton=\\"Deploy Now\\"\\nSELECT iasql_install(\'aws_ecs_simplified\', \'aws_codebuild\');\\nINSERT INTO ecs_simplified(app_name, app_port, image_tag, public_ip) VALUES(\\n  \'simple-express\',\\n  8088,\\n  \'latest\',\\n  true\\n);\\nSELECT iasql_apply();\\n\\nSELECT ecr_build(\\n  \'https://github.com/iasql/iasql-engine/\', -- the Github repo URL\\n  (SELECT id\\n    FROM repository\\n    WHERE repository_name = \'simple-express-repository\')::varchar(255), -- ECR repo for the image to be pushed\\n  \'./examples/ecs-fargate/prisma/app\', -- the subdirectory in Github repo\\n  \'main\', -- the Github branch or ref\\n  NULL -- Github personal access token - can be omitted if public repository\\n);\\n```\\nThat\'s it! Now wait for some time and your app is deployed! While your app is being deployed, let\'s go through the commands we executed in more depth:\\n```sql\\nSELECT iasql_install(\'aws_ecs_simplified\', \'aws_codebuild\');\\n```\\n- This command installs the `aws_ecs_simplified` high-level module. We\u2013 at IaSQL\u2013 have created that module to make it easy to deploy containerized apps to ECS. The code for it is [here](https://github.com/iasql/iasql-engine/blob/v0.0.22/src/modules/0.0.23/aws_ecs_simplified/sql/after_install.sql). But IaSQL is so flexible that anyone can create their own high-level (and of course, low-level) modules and add it to IaSQL.\\n```sql\\nINSERT INTO ecs_simplified(app_name, app_port, image_tag, public_ip) VALUES(\\n  \'simple-express\',\\n  8088,\\n  \'latest\',\\n  true\\n);\\n```\\n- This command creates a new `ecs_simplified` app by inserting a new row into the `ecs_simplified` table. Seems pretty easy, right? But under the hood, it\'s creating all the necessary resources like load balancers, security groups, IAM roles, etc.\\n- You can manually check the tables to see what resources are being created. For example, looking at the `load_balancer` table you\'ll see a load balancer named `simple-express-load-balancer` is inserted automatically by running the above insert command.\\n```sql\\nSELECT iasql_apply();\\n```\\n- The insert command did create the list for what resources should be created, but they\'ve not yet created on the AWS. You need to call the `iasql_apply()` function to sync the cloud with the data on your database.\\n- For more info on the `iasql_apply()` command, check [this guide](https://iasql.com/docs/apply-and-sync/#apply-and-preview_apply) on how it works.\\n- After running the `iasql_apply()` function to completion all the necessary resources are now created on the cloud, so their ARNs are populated. You can verify this by looking at different tables, eg. `iam_role`.\\n- To get your load balancer address, you can easily run `SELECT load_balancer_dns FROM ecs_simplified WHERE app_name = \'simple-express\'` query and get the URL to access your app.\\n- Now ECS is waiting for an image to be pushed to your ECR repository to run it. You can get the URI for the ECR repository by running the `SELECT repository_uri FROM ecs_simplified WHERE app_name = \'simple-express\'` query.  You *could* build your docker image locally and then follow [Steps 2 and 4 from this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/getting-started-cli.html) to connect your local docker CLI to your ECR repository and push that docker image into your ECR repository, but we have a simpler solution next.\\n- In the next step, we\'ll automatically build an image for the code in Github repo and then push it to this URI (all through SQL and using another high-level function named `ecr_build`).\\n```sql\\nSELECT ecr_build(\\n  \'https://github.com/iasql/iasql-engine/\', -- the Github repo URL\\n  (SELECT id\\n    FROM repository\\n    WHERE repository_name = \'simple-express-repository\')::varchar(255), -- ECR repo for the image to be pushed\\n  \'./examples/ecs-fargate/prisma/app\', -- the subdirectory in Github repo\\n  \'main\',  -- the Github branch or ref\\n  NULL -- Github personal access token - can be omitted if public repository\\n);\\n```\\n- This command tells IaSQL to go clone `iasql-engine` repository, build an image on the subdirectory specified, and then push it to the ECR repository created earlier by the `aws_ecs_simplified` module. Running the above command will automatically create a CodeBuild project and the related roles, etc. Then it\'ll start a build, and after it\'s successful all the created resources are deleted to ensure there won\'t be any additional charges to your AWS account.\\n- To access your app on the cloud, get the load balancer address and use your browser to access the live version of it:\\n```sql\\nSELECT load_balancer_dns\\nFROM ecs_simplified\\nWHERE app_name = \'simple-express\';\\n```\\nThen you can check if the server is running on the `<load_balancer_dns value>:8088/health` address.\\n\\n## Low-level Access to Resources\\n\\nSo the `aws_ecs_simplified` module simplifies things, right? But what if you still need the level of control you had when you were doing all the steps manually? The traditional PaaS trade-off is that you can\'t grow your app beyond the built-in limitations as you don\'t have access to all the small details. The IaSQL approach is not limited in that way.\\n\\nLet\'s say you want your ECS container to be able to use the AWS CLI to provision an EC2 instance, and for that purpose its IAM role needs `AmazonEC2FullAccess` policy to work properly. `aws_ecs_simplified` does not have a column to configure such a thing, but that doesn\'t mean we\'re stuck.\\n\\nThe good news is that you still have the full control over all resources in the deepest details. Let\'s fix your app\'s IAM role access by attaching the needed policy to its IAM role:\\n```sql\\nUPDATE iam_role\\nSET attached_policies_arns = attached_policies_arns ||\\n                             \'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess\' -- attached_policies_arns is of text[] type\\nWHERE role_name = \'simple-express-ecs-task-exec-role\';\\n\\n```\\n\\nYou want additional rules for the container\'s security group? No problem! Just write the SQL and execute it, and it will be applied to the cloud within seconds. You want 3 copies of your container to be kept running with a round-robin load balancing on them? It\'s already there, just do an `UPDATE ecs_simplified SET desired_count = 3 WHERE app_name = \'simple_express\';` and it\'s there for you.\\n\\nWith IaSQL and its flexibility, you can benefit from both the high-level and low-level operations. We have created the `aws_ecs_simplified` module to show the flexibility and power of IaSQL engine, but the possibilities are endless. IaSQL is also an open-source project, meaning that you can use the powerful IaSQL engine and build your own modules on top of that.

Changing your infrastructure\xa0*is*\xa0a set of operations to perform, a program. A SQL database is a set of information and SQL queries read or change that data.\\n\\n**Infrastructure State is Data, Infrastructure Change is Code. It\'s as simple as that.**\\n\\nAnd manipulating your infrastructure in this way is natural.\\n\\n```sql\\nINSERT INTO aws_ec2 (ami_id, ec2_instance_type_id)\\nSELECT ami.id, ait.id\\nFROM ec2_instance_type as ait, (\\n    SELECT id\\n    FROM   amis\\n    WHERE  image_name LIKE \'amzn-ami-hvm-%\'ORDER BY creation_date DESC\\n    LIMIT 1\\n) as ami\\nWHERE  ait.instance_name = \'t2.micro\';\\n```\\n\\n## **Relations and Types Matter for Infrastructure**\\n\\nInfrastructure as Code solutions do not have a good way of encoding dependencies across infrastructure pieces in a micro services architecture which makes it really hard to make and revert changes to infrastructure.\\n\\nRepresenting your infrastructure as SQL resolves the primary issue of YAML-based infrastructure tools by making the relations between pieces of your infrastructure first-class citizens, and enforcing type safety on the data and changes to it.\\n\\nYou can\'t set the EC2 instance type as\xa0`t2.mucro`\xa0and have your deploy system try and fail to create such an instance. The\xa0`insert`\xa0statement will fail and tell you zero rows were inserted and you can quickly see why.\\n\\nSimilarly, if you have a record in the\xa0`security_group`\xa0table, you can\'t delete it if there are any references to it in the\xa0`ec2_security_groups`\xa0join table. The relational structure of IaSQL prevents you from putting your infrastructure into an invalid state.\\n\\n## **New Powers: Explore, Query, and Automate Your Infrastructure**\\n\\nBecause your infrastructure is presented as a SQL database, you can connect to it with a SQL client of your choice and explore what you have and what the possibilities are.\\n\\n```sql\\nSHOW tables;\\n```\\n\\nYou can query for unusual usage patterns.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT aws_ec2.*\\nFROM aws_ec2\\nINNER JOIN ec2_instance_type AS ait ON ait.id = aws_ec2.ec2_instance_type_id\\nWHERE ait.vcpus > 8\\nORDER BY ait.vcpus DESC\\n```\\n\\nAnd since it is a database, you can create your own tables with their own meaning and associate them with your infrastructure.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT aws_ec2.*\\nFROM aws_ec2\\nINNER JOIN company_team_ec2s AS cte ON cte.aws_ec2_id = aws_ec2.id\\nINNER JOIN company_teams AS ct ON ct.id = cte.company_team_id\\nWHERE ct.name = \'Data Engineering\'\\n```\\n\\nFinally, your applications can know much more about what infrastructure they need than any auto-scaler solution out there. If you had a very infrequent but CPU/GPU-intensive job you need to handle at an unknown interval, you could give your application access to your IaSQL database and let it temporarily create and then destroy those resources.\\n\\n```jsx\\nconst ec2_instance_id = await iasql(`\\n  INSERT INTO aws_ec2 (ami_id, ec2_instance_type_id)\\n  SELECT ami.id, ait.id\\n  FROM ec2_instance_type as ait, (\\n      SELECT id\\n      FROM amis\\n      WHERE image_name = \'application-job-runner\'\\n  ) as ami\\n  WHERE ait.instance_name = \'g3.4xlarge\'\\n  RETURNING id;\\n`);\\nawait iasql(`\\n  INSERT INTO ec2_security_groups (ec2_id, security_group_id)\\n  SELECT ${ec2_instance_id}, sg.id\\n  FROM security_groups AS sg\\n  WHERE sg.name = \'application-job-group\';\\n`);\\n// Only large-enough job runners will take it based on job metadata\\nconst result = await job.run(myMassiveJob); \\nawait iasql(`\\n  DELETE FROM aws_ec2\\n  WHERE id = ${ec2_instance_id};\\n`);\\n```\\n\\n## **You Don\'t Need to Learn a New API (Probably)**\\n\\nNearly all cloud backend systems depend on a database, and most likely a SQL database, so you do not need to learn a new language to manipulate the infrastructure in this way.\\n\\nAnd likely you\'re using a\xa0[migration system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration)\xa0in your backend to review changes to your database, which you can continue to use here, making it code to be reviewed, just like Infrastructure-as-Code.\\n\\n## **You Can Test, Too**\\n\\nSince the safety guarantees are provided by the types and relations between tables, you can simply copy your production infrastructure database into a local database and run your changes/migration against that and verify it works before you run it on your actual Infrastructure-as-SQL database.\\n\\n## **Recover With Ease**\\n\\nIt\'s 3AM and your service has gone down. You reverted the most recent IaSQL migration, but that didn\'t resolve the issue, and you aren\'t sure which change across which service today caused the outage. So, you simply replace the state of the IaSQL database with a snapshot from yesterday to bring everything back online to a known-good-state, and then take your time after you\'re well-rested to figure out what actually went wrong."}]}')}}]);
